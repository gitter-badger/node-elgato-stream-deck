### Events

#### <a name="down"></a> `> down`

Fired whenever a key is pressed. `keyIndex` is the 0-14 numerical index of that key.

##### Example

```javascript
streamDeck.on('down', keyIndex => {
    console.log('key %d down', keyIndex);
});
```

#### <a name="up"></a> `> up`

Fired whenever a key is released. `keyIndex` is the 0-14 numerical index of that key.

##### Example

```javascript
streamDeck.on('up', keyIndex => {
    console.log('key %d up', keyIndex);
});
```

#### <a name="error"></a> `> error`

Fired whenever an error is detected by the `node-hid` library.
**Always** add a listener for this event! If you don't, errors will be silently dropped.

##### Example

```javascript
streamDeck.on('error', keyIndex => {
    console.log('key %d error', keyIndex);
});
```
